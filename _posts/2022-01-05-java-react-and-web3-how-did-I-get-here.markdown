I started my career as a Java developer, after about 8 years the web development world was changing...

AngularJS was starting to become more and more popular so I decided to leave my comfort zone and jump in with both feet into Front End development...

Fast forward to present times... I'm feeling the same itches and the same need to do something out of my comfort zone, and guess what... Web3 is raising in popularity so... why not jump again?

## Where I Started?

Putting aside all the hype on Twitter, I found a few places where I felt it was good to focus on.

[CriptoZombies.io](https://cryptozombies.io/) is fun to code and make progress while creating a super simple game. After the first path, it dives into more advanced concepts but leaving the zombies aside. I'm only missing the last path to complete this course.

[LearnWeb3.io](https://www.learnweb3.io/) seems to be more mature and organized, it consist of four track (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior and Senior). Here I have completed the first track and near to completing the second one. As a plus, you can receive an NFT as a "certification" for each track you complete... You can check mine in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/__Ariel__).

Last but not least, freeCodeCamp has recently published a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ) that is causing a lot of hype and will be my next one to keep learning and adding knowledge.

## What is next?

In the future I plan to keep writing brief posts like this one to consolidate knowledge, some sort of notes I can quickly check in the future, so feel free to come back and check and even better, start your own path to learn Web3 and register your progress! :)

Thanks for reading!
