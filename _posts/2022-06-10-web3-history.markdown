## Web1
It was mainly about providing the everyday consumer with online content and information. While web1 was read-only, the companies we associate with web1 were built on open protocols (meaning pretty much any person or organization could build on the internet and know they were subject to the same rules as the next person or organization).

## Web2
It is the internet most of us know and use today. Where Web1 was static and “read-only”, Web2 is “read-write”, and interactive. Under Web2, the internet became more usable: web2 was dynamic and users could create content on the internet themselves.

Along the way, the internet became largely dominated by the four behemoths we know today as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google. Why is this a problem? In the centralized internet we know today, Apple can take a 30% cut on all paid-app downloads and in-app purchases, Twitter and Facebook can de-platform the POTUS, and the everyday consumer has less privacy, security, and control over their online information than ever before.

## Web3
It is a decentralized internet. Under Web3, the internet is shared online and governed by the collective “we,” rather than owned by centralized entities. Web3 enhances the web we know today by making it decentralized, distributed, open, trustless and permissionless.

* It is getting built such that everything would happen in a decentralized distributed way giving no central authority access to control the system.
* **Open** as it would be open sourced software built by an open and accessible community of developers and executed in full view of the world.
* **Trustless** in that the network itself allows participants to interact publicly or privately without a trusted third party.
* **Permissionless** in that anyone, both users and suppliers,can participate without authorisation from a governing body.
